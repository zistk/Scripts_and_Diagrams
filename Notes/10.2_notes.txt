Cryptography 10.2 notes
Cypher-is the type of encryption
Cypher text - the scrambled data of a word or series of words


Activity 1
openssl enc -in message.txt -out message.txt.enc -nosalt -base64 -aes-256-cbc -k

openssl enc -d -in message.txt.enc -out new.txt -k <encryption> -iv <iv-encryption> -nosalt -pbkdf2


lessons

-secure key exchange
	-a key must be created for every interaction
	-this creates a disadvantege

-number of keys
-formula (N*(N-1))/2
	-symetric encryption
*(N)=Number of people

-asemetric
-private key
	-kept secret and can affect confidentialitty if message is exposed
	-used to decypt messages from others using your public key
-public key 
	-acessable to all
	-used to allow others to encrypt messages
-RSA
	-algorithm called rsa is used in asymetric encryption
	-named aget the last name of the creators
formula N*2

GPG 
-GNU Privacy Gaurd
-asymetrical encryption tool on linux
->gpg --gen-key
->gpg --armor --output instructot.gpg --export ethan@gxample.com
-importing public key
->gpg --armor --import kevin.gpg
->gpg --list-keys #lists all the public keys to others that you may want to message
->gpg --armor --import dillon.gpg
->gpg --armor --output ciphertext.txt --encrypt --recipent keven@icloud.com
->gpg --output message.txt --decypt message.enc



Hashes
-diffrent from encryption
-ususally used to hide passwords
-its a one way function and you cant get back something that is hashed without doing the work
-encyption is about privacy
-hashes are about integrety
-SHA 1/2


digital signatures
-used to varify a user and the authenticity of the message



activity 3
#on ubuntu linux
->echo "this is realy from me " > message.txt
->gpg -output signature --armor --detach-sig message.txt
->cat signature
#has signature
#other person
-> gpg --verify signature message.txt



recap
provides signiture with message
->gpg --output message.sig --clearsign message.txt
#to check if it hadent been chaged
->gpg --varify message.sig
->gpg --output message_signed.txt --clearsign message.txt
gpg --varify trevs

10.3
-symetric encription
--bitlocker on windows
--filevault on mac
-email
--email usually dosnt have encryption
-ssl
 -otherwise known as TLS
  -negosiates an encrypted channel 
#shows the image
->eog family.jpg 
->echo "this secret message" > message.txt
->steghide embed --cf family.jpg -ef message.txt
#checks diffrences
#if you have two coppies of the same image
->diff family.jpeg family_1.jpeg
#extracts data
-steghide extract -sf family.jpeg

activity 1 today
eog mydreamcar.jpg
#extracting message
->steghide extract -sf mydreamcar.jpg
#password: delorian
#if you cant run "eog" on the picture then you might not be able too

SSL/TLS cretificates
-under the lock near your browser
-certificate athority
 -places that generate certs 
-certificate signing request 
-chain of trust
 -root cets authoritys
 -lists of CA's that your browser to trust


- cryptographic methods
  - statistical attacks
   - if the nuber generated is infact predictable and not random, a hacker can determine the nuber and the access of unautherized words
  - brute force attack
   - a way of continuing to try passwords
   - lockout features can limit the ammount of tries
 - Birthday attacks
   - exploit the probability that two separate plaintexts that use the same hash algorithm will produce the same ciphertext(also knwn as collision and hashing collision)
   - stronger hash algorithms limit the possibilities of a repeat
 - frequency analysis
  - tries to crack the most frequently used letters in cyphertext
 - replay attack
  - intercepts a key or signal to replicate it to use it again


->echo a >rainbox
->echo a |md5sum >> rainbox
->echo bb >> rainbox
->echo bb | md5sum >> rainbox
#this rainbowtable (rainbox) will be filled with all the hashed versions of whatever i wanted
#this one will be an md5sum rainbowtable

        >>          enabled: yes
- then run ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/install-Elk.yml

- make a new inbound security rule
    1. on port 5601
    2. protocol = any
    3. source = <my ip>
    4. destination = Virtual network

    then in the search bar
    http://<the VM's ip>:5601/app/kibana **refer to your instructer on the correct URL**

    3.do >sudo docker ps 
    4.sudo docker stop elk
    5. sudo docker rm elk 
    6. back on ansible container
    7. nano /etc/ansible/install-elk.yml
    8. replace on download and launch elk container image: sebp/elk w/ sebp/elk:740
    9.save and exit then rerun ansible-platbook /etc/ansible/intall-elk.yml
    
    10.new yml
** in ansible container /etc/ansible

Day 3 create a git reposiory that is public

Create a network diagram and Documentation




















Homework Help commands
- Make a README.md 
- make a clone of the repository
- then run -> git clone <clone from HUB>
    #commands
    -> git status
    -> git diff # to see what has been changed
    -> git add README.md
    -> git commit -m "this is the first commit"
    -> git log #show history of states like the status command
    # nothing is on the hub repository we've make and edited the clone
    -> git pull # pulls the current HUB repository
    -> git push # pushes the clone into the Hub repository 
    


- modify it 
all in the ~/school/schoo_sub/ELKstack_repo_Hw
to do list: create the read me with the corect diagrams and images
            updated diagram
            add the YML files






52.247.204.112
10.1.0.4


HW continued
- get screenshots of:
    - Vm's
    - ansible containers
    - YML files
    - config files
    - docker ps output
    - the ELK server url and the Kibana page
